            <p>I think I have written enough works to call myself a novice writer of sorts. Quite a compliment! But a hobby which started out of absolute frustration flowing out needing a medium to express to a fun habit to record my thoughts has a lot more to it than just letters or words or expressions. Which brings me to- the story of the writer. Exactly why did I write. And why is most of my writings with the “I” component rather than the “you”.
            </p>
            <p>People know best what they have seen most. And that is the simple reason why my works are all very personal containing the subject, revolving around the subject and focusing on solely one character the most. Every other character, no matter how prominent, no matter how understood, simply lacks the sophistication and detail of me. So, I place myself in every story and start from me. Every short story has been a journey intertwining fantasy and reality bringing me from the starting word to the ending, realizing new points, turns, twists. Which is why I don’t write on demand, simply because I haven’t met the other characters, and haven't really known them. I could write about the person down the street, I could write about the shopkeeper I see every week, the conductor in my weekly travel home, but when I start writing they appear very two-dimensional, lacking description, lacking voice and lacking reason. Writing is an art of conviction much like law. You start proving something and at every point you have to turn the truth to make it appear real, to create the blocks which make it come to life just enough to make it seem alive. Every reader is the jury and perhaps you can’t convince the whole bench but a majority often marks the success or failure while a single person signifies a rare understanding.
            </p>
            <p>Experienced writers have the vantage point of separating their names, identities and thoughts from the book as they adorn another name, another personality with its own thoughts, identities and identity like an unborn child, barely in existence and living nonetheless. But me? My disjunction to understand people only extends to viewing their path and not walking it, which makes me unable to adopt their voice without seeming fake and likening myself to the identity thieves or “catfishers” of the internet, with an air of inauthenticity and broken thought processes. Writing for me is a flow, rather than a revised portion. It is my revision of life at every point without breakage of thought.
            </p>
            
            <p>Not to say that I have never had an experience lying about my identity. ‘Hi, I am Katie’ I type out on the chat. It was my internet identity. There was no malicious intent. Just to know what it would be like to actually be Katie. To speak to people as Katie. To behave like Katie. To be known as Katie. But there would be this voice of authentic statehood which claims ‘But you are not Katie’ and inevitably ‘Katie’ would break down into merely a fake name adorning my personality.</p>

                I started writing as ‘Shikha’. Pretend. Think you are her. What would she think? How do I know her? Aha! Through her childhood. Build a random childhood. Like a random set generator, I got a randomized childhood and wore it, hoping to pass off as Shikha. So, I am a married woman with a child and I am naturally happy…….. What do I think? Initially, Shikha had a perfect life. But I knew the Shikha’s of the world did not have a happy life. Happy people were not mythical creatures only appearing in stories and those supernatural make-believes. And their lives too like the general population was very chaotic. Generally, the happy people, I’ve noticed, were not deep thinkers. Cut off the enlightened ones or the sages or the ones simply denouncing life. The ones in social standing, with a social identity and undeniably happy ones are either- pretending, just happy right now or just plain happy. The plain happy ones are the hardest to understand. They see life going haywire and rarely give a thought about it. So, how do I write about someone who thinks less? They have a thought process but it is generally not deep thinking but more in-the-moment what-is-happening thinking. How do I make them sound not unintelligent, just not thinking much about anything other than right now? Did their life move faster? Would the story be uninteresting owing to the fact that the background objects had far greater voice than my usually “subject” heavy voice writings? More importantly, would it do them justice or would I make them insultingly less thought oriented and intelligent due to lack of not understanding rather than a truly maligning outlook towards them. The character started but I started losing the interest to continue. Was it out of boredom or the lack of interest in knowing this person? Did I not trust perpetually happy people or am I just not very close to them out of lack of understanding? Did my empathy diminish out of differences solely because I couldn’t understand them as much as I find comfort in calling myself ‘understanding’? Eventually, I started a conversation with Shikha and the thing is- she seemed inauthentic or unappealing to the point that her conversations seemed like trying to make everything positive solely because positive is better. So, we turned the conversation to why she was positive. She was surprisingly insightful at this and Shikha for the first time came to life as an equal rather than a subordinate.

            <p>I did not finish the work. I could not digest the fact that the one story I had written to deviate from “I” had at the end taken a U-turn to hit me back and “I” and the truth was only when it reached “I” did it have insight. Only then did it make sense and only then did I enjoy the process. I guess it would be injustice to call me a writer perhaps. My writings never seem to be about the reader, ignoring their presence or absence like the onlookers at a play as I dive into the art, painting a thought into a picture that appears beautiful to me.</p>
            
            <p>Maybe one day, I shall grow as an artist to honour the crowd, outgrowing my childish narcissism or perhaps I shall remain the sole remaining member through which every contributory factor passes transforming them into thoughts that are mine alone to share. The solitary orator.</p>
